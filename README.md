### HOW TO INSTALL
-----------------------------------
- Edit config.json with your discord account token and the imagepath (if its in the same location as the all_together.py file you only need to type cool.jpg)
- Run all_together.py (do not run code you not aware of. you can look in the sourcecode to see, that i not implemented anything that cause harm to your pc)
- All required modules will be automatically installed so there is no need to install them manually like you needed to do in the older versions
- Make sure to email and phoneverify your account. for email you can use outlook or a catch all mail with custom domain. Use https://5sim.net for phoneverification
- Let the group maker run for a day or two so can get around 3k groups

### GOOD TO KNOW
use it with vpn if you have bad proxies. discord will disable accounts if used bad ones

### What you can expect in the paid version, that will be out in a few months:
- multi token support
- multi proxy support
- custom useragents
- option to remove all users from groups
- option that invites your main account from all tokens, then the tokens leave so you get ownership
- and more if suggested
