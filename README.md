# EDUCATIONAL ONLY! DESCRIPTION BELOW IS FROM SOMEONE ELSE!!

### HOW TO INSTALL
-----------------------------------
1. Edit config.json with your discord account token and the imagepath (if its in the same location as the all_ogether.py file you only need to type cool.jpg)
2. run all_together.py (do not run code you not aware of. you can look in the sourcecode to see, that i not implemented anything that cause harm to your pc)
3. all required modules will be automatically installed so there is no need to install them manually like you needed to do in the older versions
4. make sure to email and phoneverify your account. for email you can use outlook or a catch all mail with custom domain. Use https://5sim.net for phoneverification
5. let the group maker run for a day or two so can get around 3k groups
=================================================================
Same script like the orginal one but just better lmao

### GOOD TO KNOW
use it with vpn if you have bad proxies. discord will disable accounts if used bad ones

### What you can expect in coming releases:
- multi token support
- multi proxy support
- custom useragents
- and more if suggested
