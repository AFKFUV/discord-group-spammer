# EDUCATIONAL ONLY! DESCRIPTION BELOW IS FROM SOMEONE ELSE!!

SINCE RETARDS ARE STARTING TO SELL THIS SHIT CODE ITS TIME TO MAKE IT PUBLIC

HOW TO INSTALL
-----------------------------------
1. group_maker.py the libs you need are requests discum json and time
discum will need to be installed with this command 
python -m pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M.git#egg=discum

2. you need 1 token to run the whole thing (having it phone number verified will make it last wayyyyyy longer)

3. let the group maker run for a day or two so can get around 3k groups or change the code and make it support multiple accounts 
=================================================================
Same script like the orginal one but just better lmao

What i add later and do another pull request:
- multi token support
- multi proxy support
- using multiprocessing instead of threads (even faster)
- custom useragents
(use it with vpn if you have bad proxies. discord will disable accounts if used bad ones)
(all that stuff i will add for free dont fucking pay for such a sexy tool)
